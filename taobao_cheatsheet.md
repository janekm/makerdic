Many electronics shops on Taobao offer a BOM order service. To make use of this, create a BOM for your project
(if any components could benefit from clear identification, such as switches or connectors, it's a good idea to add pictures)
as a spreadsheet (XLS), open a chat session with the seller using Aliwangwang, and send them the file. They
will send back the spreadsheet with the prices for components listed. For components for which Chinese cloned
versions exist it is wise to indicate whether the "imported" (进口) or "Chinese" (国产) version should be supplied.
